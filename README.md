# Java Learning 
### Description
My personal repo for learning java swing so that I could master it in some day
### Target
The day that I started to learn is 2nd of June and my target for learning this in one month - which mean I will end at 2nd of July - with a small project using almost of the things that I learn

### Daily Log
#### 2nd of June
I have learn how to using JFrame to create an application frame and label to add text and icon.

##### Note:
When we pass the file path address, we have to write a path with directory in  the project then the name of the file. Example: "src/Main/Hi.png"

#### 3rd of June
I have learn how to using JLabel and JPanel for customize text, content in different part of the JFrame. There still have some more things that I haven't learned yet, but when I have personal project I will figure it out by my self
